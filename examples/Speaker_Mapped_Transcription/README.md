# Speaker Identification and Transcription Mapping Using Vector Search

This project enables speaker diarization and transcription by mapping detected speakers to their actual names using vector search. It uses diarization outputs, applies speaker-name mapping, and aligns timestamps with transcriptions.  

### Usage  
Process audio files, generate diarization results, map speakers using vector search, and export transcriptions with speaker labels. Note that we are saving our embeddings on **Azure Blob Storage** in this example. You can chose to switch to local or any other object store as per your preference.

### Creating Known Database of Speakers using LanceDB
We first create a known database of speakers (say employees in a company). This database is used to get correct speaker names based on audio similarity.

### Transcription and Diarization
Next we take the input audio and create a transcript using OpenAI's Whisper Model. We also utilize Nemo-MSDD model by Nvidia for diarization.

### How are we doing this together?
This high-level flow diagram will help you understand how we are building this together. We are creating a known database of speakers, and when generating the transcription, we utilize this database to get the correct speaker names.

### Features  
- Speaker diarization and transcription  
- Mapping detected speakers to actual names using LanceDB vector search.
- Forced alignment for accurate word timestamps (limited)  
- Updated RTTM File with correct speaker names.

### Notes  
Ensure proper speaker colab setup for accurate mapping. Adjust configurations based on the data and computation.
