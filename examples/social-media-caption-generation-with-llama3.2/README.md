## Social Media Caption Generation using Llama3.2 11B Vision

Thinking fancy captions for social media is boredom. Newly released Llama3.2 11B vision that supports image reasoning can do this task quite easily, This example notebook demonstrates it.

In this example, we'll use `conceptual_captions` dataset by Google Research. Image descriptions in the dataset are mainly utilized for searching relevant image and then utilizing the resultant image as an social media image for which we'll be generating fancy social media caption.
